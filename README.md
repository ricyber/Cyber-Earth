# Cyber-earth üåê

## Project Description

**Cyber-earth** is an interactive web visualization that lets you explore global cybersecurity information. The project simulates a "server access" interface with a retro-hacker aesthetic, inviting you to interact with a 3D model of Earth to discover classified data on cyberattacks and cybersecurity regulations in different countries.

### Key Features

* **Interactive Visualization**: A 3D model of Earth that you can rotate and interact with.
* **Stylized User Interface**: A sci-fi-themed UI inspired by the *Matrix* aesthetic and console code typography.
* **Dynamic Information**: Click on specific points on the map to reveal modal windows with detailed information on cybersecurity in each country.
* **Visual Effects**: Includes text flicker effects and a moving starfield background for an immersive experience.
* **Multilingual Support**: Supports multiple languages (e.g., Spanish and English) for broader accessibility.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: For the project's structure.
* **CSS3**: For UI styling, animations, and responsive design.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For the project's interactive logic.
* **Three.js**: To render the 3D Earth model and the space scene.
* **GSAP (GreenSock)**: To control complex animations, such as the modal window and shooting stars.

## How to Run It

To run the project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No local server is required.

1.  Open the `index.html` file in Chrome, Firefox, or any other modern browser.
